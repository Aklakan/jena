/**
 * A base implementation of AutoClosable that helps detecting resource leaks.
 * Creation of an instance of this class captures a snapshot of the stack trace.
 * If finalize is called (typically only by the GC) and there was no prior call to close then
 * a warning including the stack trace is logged.
 *
 * Implementing classes need to override {@link #closeActual()} because {@link #close()} is final.
